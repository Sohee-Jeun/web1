    <h2>Chapter One</h2>
    <h3>OWL POST</h3>


    <p><strong><u>Harry Potter</u></strong> was a highly unusual boy in many ways. For one thing, he
    hated the summer holidays more than any other time of year. For another,
    he really wanted to do his homework but was forced to do it in secret,
    in the dead of night. And he also happened to be a wizard.
    It was nearly midnight, and he was lying on his stomach in bed, the
    blankets drawn right over his head like a tent, a flashlight in one hand
    and a large leather-bound book (A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot)
    propped open against the pillow. Harry moved the tip of his
    eagle-feather quill down the page, frowning as he looked for something
    that would help him write his essay, "Witch Burning in the Fourteenth
    Century Was Completely Pointless discuss."</p>

    The quill paused at the top of a likely-looking paragraph. Harry Pushed
    his round glasses up the bridge of his nose, moved his flashlight closer
    to the book, and read:<br>

    Non-magic people (more commonly known as Muggles) were particularly
    afraid of magic in medieval times, but not very good at recognizing it.
    On the rare occasion that they did catch a real witch or wizard, burning
    had no effect whatsoever. The witch or wizard would perform a basic
    Flame Freezing Charm and then pretend to shriek with pain while enjoying
    a gentle, tickling sensation. Indeed, Wendelin the Weird enjoyed being
    burned so much that she allowed herself to be caught no less than
    fortyseven times in various disguises.<br>
