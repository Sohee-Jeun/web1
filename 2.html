    <h2>CHAPTER TWO</h2>
    <h3>AUNT MARGE'S BIG MISTAKE</h3>

    <p>Harry went down to breakfast the next morning to find the three Dursleys
    already sitting around the kitchen table. They were watching a brand-new
    television, a welcome-home-for-the-summer present for Dudley, who had
    been complaining loudly about the long walk between the fridge and the
    television in the living room. Dudley had spent most of the summer in
    the kitchen, his piggy little eyes fixed on the screen and his five
    chins wobbling as he ate continually.</p>

    <p>Harry sat down between Dudley and Uncle Vernon, a large, beefy man with
    very little neck and a lot of mustache. Far from wishing Harry a happy
    birthday, none of the Dursleys made any sign that they had noticed Harry
    enter the room, but Harry was far too used to this to care. He helped
    himself to a piece of toast and then looked up at the reporter on the
    television, who was halfway through a report on an escaped convict:</p>

    <p>"... The public is warned that Black is armed and extremely dangerous. A
    special hot line has been set up, and any sighting of Black should be
    reported immediately."</p>
