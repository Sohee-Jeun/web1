    <h2>CHAPTER THREE</h2>
    <h3>THE KNIGHT BUS</h3>

    <p>Harry was several streets away before he collapsed onto a low wall in
    Magnolia Crescent, panting from the effort of dragging his trunk. He sat
    quite still, anger still surging through him, listening to the frantic
    thumping of his heart.</p>


    <p>But after ten minutes alone in the dark street, a new emotion overtook
    him: panic. Whichever way he looked at it, he had never been in a worse
    fix. He was stranded, quite alone, in the dark Muggle world, with
    absolutely nowhere to go. And the worst of it was, he had just done
    serious magic, which meant that he was almost certainly expelled from
    Hogwarts. He had broken the Decree for the Restriction of Underage
    Wizardry so badly, he was surprised Ministry of Magic representatives
    weren't swooping down on him where he sat.</p>
