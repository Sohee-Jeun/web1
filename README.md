### Very First Project.

This is a web page that I made very first time. I studied about overall HTML.

## What I've learned
1. What is HTML?
2. Tags -> heading, list, link, paragrahp, video, img
3. Inserting Video, image, comments.

## Harry Potter Book Part
You can read short Harry potter book. I put the title which is 'Harry Potter Book' using a 'h1' tag and put chapter1,2,3 using 'ul' tag and 'li'. It links to the other pages which are included several lines of each chapter.

## Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
When you click this title you can go to Information page of Harry Potter movie.
  
## Video
I put the video of Harry Potter Trailer.
